                <section id="intro" class="main">
                           
                        <p>Current Brazilian urban policy has laid the groundwork for favela residents to begin to claim their right to the city; while many Brazilian municipalities have initiated an activation of federal urban policy by planning better cities both with and for their residents, the Rio de Janeiro municipality has instead averted and manipulated many of these policies in their preparation for past and upcoming mega events. The momentum of these global events have advanced the city into a state of exception that has served as a catalyst for an amalgamation of stakeholders and public-private partnerships to begin to privatize public resources in order to prime the city of Rio for the global stage.  The operative framing of Rio as a global city has allowed pervasive narratives of “formality” versus “informality” to permeate and shape mega event planning practice and has thus sanctioned the evasion of federal urban policy by the Rio de Janeiro Municipality - where this evasion of urban policy within planning practice has effectively conceded to the displacement of over 77,000 residents between the years of 2009 and 2015.<br><br> This thesis seeks to explore the dialectical relationships between the multiple policy perspectives of the federal government, the municipality and the favelados to the resettlement of favela residents and subsequent gentrification of their neighborhoods in a current state of exception. The objectives of this research will be to consider the significance and centrality of the favela within Rio de Janeiro’s city logic by considering its “informality”, instead, as a productive form of practice; to achieve an advanced understanding of current Brazilian Federal Urban Policies involving The Right to the City, The Right to Adequate Housing and Land Regularization; to identify how these policies are translated within the favela pre and post states of exception; and finally, to understand what The Right to the City means within the favela and how its meaning may be augmented to compliment each unique favela agglomeration. <br><br> In this examination I employ methods of design-thinking in order to productively disrupt the problematic narratives of informality by translating and adapting federal urban policy to aid in the political agency of favelados. The task of design within this project will be to both “encourage and support the discourse and practice of the social production of places of “cooperation” by organizing conditions of co-existence and coproduction, and by enabling “action in conjunction.” I do this by uncovering the ways in which existing urban policy may be translated spatially and visually in order to empower favela residents to effectively critique the current conditions produced by a municipal-level liberalization of federal urban policy. Specifically, I work to expose the ways in which favela residents may be able to make more informed decisions about their land tenure, land rights, and claiming a right to the city both within and outside of states of exception through the creation of a land rights instrument.<br><br>  The land rights instrument is a tool which features three distinct components that combine to create a comprehensive body of knowledge and resources for favela residents: Education, Legalization, and Collectivization. Along with its components, this tool strives to touch upon three distinct features that will measure its success over time. The first is that of <i>embeddedness</i>, this proposal must be pertinent to and useful for each community that it comes in contact with. For the tool to begin to be embedded, I have synthesized information from previous site visits by learning from the opinions of the local residents, by observing popular communication tools and by understanding how best to communicate existing policy and land rights ideas to favelados. This tool must also be embedded in the site, itself as it must be handed over to actors within the specified territories as an instrument for use. The second feature of the tool is <i>reflexiveness</i>; this instrument must be able to be given to actors within the community that will adapt and change it over time so that it will continue to be relevant for residents seeking knowledge on land rights. The third feature is that of <i>hysteresis</i>; where this instrument is understood as a time-based system that generates durational community resilience. Therefore, it must be understood that this tool creates trans-generational social resilience by enabling communities to begin to imagine alternative forms of cohabitation that may be able to protect them from future displacement and shock both within and outside of states of exception.<br>

						<p>Based on my study of Rio de Janeiro's current condition, I developed <a href="http://coletivofavela.github.io/Coletivo_Favela/index.html"><strong><i>Coletivo Favela</i></strong></a>, which works as a land rights instrument that can both translate and adapt federal urban policy to begin to aid in the legal and political agency of favelados. Specifically, I work to expose the ways in which favela residents may be able to make more informed decisions about claiming a right to the city both within and outside of states of exception. <strong><i>With this, favela residents may be able to effectively critique the current conditions created by the municipality’s liberalization of federal urban policy in order to reclaim their right to the city in a post-Olympic environment by making more informed decisions about their land tenure and land rights.</i></strong> Coletivo Favela will feature three distinct components that combine to create a comprehensive body of knowledge and resources for favela residents: Education, Legalization, and Collectivization.</p><br>

								<h3>Comunidade!</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Comunidade! is an integral part to the land rights tool. Comunidade! is a comprehensive guidebook on collective titling. It highlights the effects of gentrification on communities, the importance of collective titling, the process of organizing around collective title, the legal steps groups must take in order to gain collective title, and resources that communities can contact that might be able to help with their collective titling needs.<br><br>This portion of the tool serves as a platform for favela residents to become informed about the benefits of collective titling, receive instruments and resources that can catalyze capacity building and organization around land rights, and to formulate new networks of resources and organizations so that these communities can begin to form Community Land Trusts (CLT).

								<h3>Gentrifição <br>e a sua Comunidade</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Gentrification is a relatively new term in Rio de Janeiro, however, gentrification is an increasingly present systemic issue in these territories and it is crucial for
                                residents to begin to comprehend the negative ramifications of development that does not serve community interests. I have organized this portion to include tactile pamphlets with illustrated step-by-step explanations of gentrification and its potential negative impacts as well as community specific maps of the impacts of development on land-value per neighborhood. I have chosen to materialize this portion of the tool as downloadable and distributable pamphlets specific to the three favelas I have chosen to intervene in for two reasons: in order to for it to be shared and dispersed throughout these communities, as well as to serve as a potential catalyst for organization and collectivization.</p>
