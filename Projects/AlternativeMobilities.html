                        <p>Based on the qualitative and quantitative study of the commuter vans that run between New York City's satellite Chinatowns, myself and a group of four others have designed a participatory process for communities that are underserved by public transportation to co-create their own mobility systems. While participatory processes have become more commonplace in urban design, mobility remains a project that is generally approached from the top-down.<br> <br>
                            <strong>We believe that the <i>Right to Mobility</i> is closely related to <i>The Right to the City</i> - and by collectively connecting parts of the city that have otherwise been neglected by traditional processes of transportation planning and political will, this right can be claimed.</strong>

                    <p>New York City may have one of the most robust transportation systems in the world but it does not work for everyone equally. People whose movement is not based on the centrality of Manhattan or a 9-5 workday have transportation needs that are underserved. <br><br>Some low-income immigrant communities have solved their own mobility problems, often with systems reminiscent of their native countries. <br><br><i><strong>"Dollar Vans"</strong></i> a misnomer now that fares have increased, are self-organized commuter vans that have become more common around the city since the 1980's. With the growth of the Chinese immigrant population, there was an an economic and cultural incentive for fast and linguistically accessible transportation between the developing Chinatowns. Unlike the other dollar vans in the city that pick up passengers all along their respective routes, the chinatown vans operate mostly as shuttles between their destinations. This system has no formal maps and emerged without authorization, but because of its success, it is currenly being assimilated into the city's authorized transporation through licensing the vans.<br><br>We came to under that the Chinatown vans to be a successful system, as measured by the riders themselves. Our mobility co-design process is informed by insights from the Chinatown vans.</p><br>
