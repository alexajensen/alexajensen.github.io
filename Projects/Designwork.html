								<h3>Graduate Thesis Publications</h3>
							</header>
							<p>These two graduate thesis publications were designed to showcase the work of the Class of 2015 Design and Urban Ecologies and Theories of Urban Practice students. Created Collaboratively with Gamar Markarian.

                                <strong>Design and Urban Ecologies</strong><br>
                                This Master of Science program radically reframes the study of cities. Through research and fieldwork, students gain a broad understanding of the complex economic, political, social, environmental, and physical forces that influence urban growth and development. Working in multidisciplinary teams, they design processes for urban transformation.

							<strong>Theories of Urban Practice</strong><br>
                            The MA Theories of Urban Practice is a research-driven graduate program for curious urban thinkers and makers interested in exploring new avenues beyond conventional urban planning and design to gain a broad understanding of the social, political, economic, and environmental forces that affect cities. <br><br>

								<h3>Lakewood City Sustainability and Planning</h3>
							</header>
							<p>During the summer of 2015 I completed a Sustainability Internship with Lakewood City Sustainability and Planning. While my work consisted of helping out with the municipal sustainability plan, I also helped to improve public outreach for the plan and plan activities.<br></p>
                            <strong>Sustainable Neighborhoods</strong><br>
                            This is a portion of marketing material that I designed in conjunction with Lakewood's Sustainable Neighborhoods Program. The Sustainable Neighborhoods Program gives residents the opportunity to become active partners in making Lakewood a vibrant and sustainable community. The progressive bike ride was designed to raise funds and awareness of local environmental issues.

                            <strong>Zero Waste Events</strong><br>
                            Part of Lakewood's Sustainability initiative was to reduce generated waste by 2050. One portion of that plan required the development of tools for the citizens of Lakewood to put to use. This toolkit is a step-by-step guide to planning a successful zero waste event.<br><br>

								<h3>The GrowHaus</h3>
							</header>
							During the summer of 2015 I completed an internship with The GrowHaus, a non-profit that produces and
                                distributes organic food to low-income communities. As their digital desgin intern, I designed communications and marketing materials that required a sensitivity to
                                local residents as well as a knowledge of the GrowHaus visual identity.

                                <strong>Seed2Seed Recipe Book</strong><br>
                            The Seed2Seed Recipe Remix book is a compilation of recipes eaten, prepared, and created by Seed2Seed students. Throughout the summer students learn to thoughtfully consider where their food comes from, how it is prepared, and how it will impact their overall health.<br><br>
