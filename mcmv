           <h3><center>Minha Casa Minha Vida is a social housing project that was added to the City Statute in 2009.</center></h3>
   
            <h2>In 2010, major downpour triggered landslides and floods in the city of Rio de Janeiro, taking the lives of 68 residents. As a response, Mayor Eduardo Paes abruptly ordered the construction of 53,000 Minha Casa Minha Vida social housing projects to be erected more than 50 kilometers away from the city center in order to relocate favela residents that <em>may occupy environmentally precarious areas</em>, however, the majority of resettlement was of households that were not directly impacted by the floods.
            <br> <br>
            While the current model for resettlement in Minha Casa Minha Vida is equipped with sanitation, water and electricity, it is placed sometimes more than 50 kilometers away from the city center. This resettlement strategy is problematic given that the challenges that this will place on the resettled will threaten their livelihood, placing a significant strain on their mobility to resources and opportunities as well as breaking the vital social ties that are necessary for vertical mobility within society. What this type of capital intervention in a state of exception seeks to reinforce is uneven development driven by the production of space in capitals' own image. Neil Smith contends that, "not only does capital produce space in general, it produces the real spatial scales that give uneven development its coherence." As the Municipality of Rio continues to uproot and displace its own residents in its newly rebranded social housing project, it becomes clear, now, that this type of resettlement strategy will unquestionably serve as a reproduction of the poverty, inequality and marginalization that the resettled had left in the favela.</h2>
